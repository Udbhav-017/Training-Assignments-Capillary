Different compression and decompression


Q. We should make all internal methods as private and compress as public  // testing reflAbstractCompressor huffman_compressor, AbstractDecompressor huffman_decompressor
Q. Problem with current strutcure: 
	How to make internal methods private  //  abstraction
	Multiple implementation with minor changes  at function level

Making single class for each function//  making them static
