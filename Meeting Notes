Different compression and decompression


Q. We should make all internal methods as private and compress as public  // testing reflAbstractCompressor huffman_compressor, AbstractDecompressor huffman_decompressor
Q. Problem with current strutcure: 
	How to make internal methods private  //  abstraction
	Multiple implementation with minor changes  at function level

Making single class for each function//  making them static


Q. How to handle: If corrupted file given to decompressor

Q. testecase:  compressed file doesnt have enough carachet to read as given in header (file corrupted)


if(Character.isLetter(ch)){
	word+=ch;
}
else{
	add(word);
	add(ch);
	word="";
}

if(word!="")
	add(word)
